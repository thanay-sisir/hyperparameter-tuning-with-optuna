# Life Expectancy Prediction and Hyperparameter Optimization with Optuna
## Project Overview
This project predicts Life Expectancy using health expenditure data with a Random Forest Regressor. It involves preprocessing data, training a model, and optimizing its performance through Optuna to fine-tune hyperparameters. The model's accuracy is evaluated using MAE, MSE, and RÂ². The project demonstrates the application of machine learning and hyperparameter optimization to real-world health data.

###  Hyperparameter Optimization with Optuna
To optimize the performance of the model, **Optuna** is used to fine-tune the hyperparameters of the Random Forest Regressor:
- **n_estimators**: Number of trees in the forest.
- **max_depth**: Maximum depth of each tree.
- **min_samples_split**: Minimum samples required to split an internal node.
- **min_samples_leaf**: Minimum samples required to be a leaf node.

The optimization process runs for 100 trials, each time adjusting these hyperparameters for better model performance.

### Rebuilding the Model
After optimizing the hyperparameters, the model is retrained with the best-found parameters, and the performance is re-evaluated to see the improvements.
